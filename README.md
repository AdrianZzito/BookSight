# Books-Visualized

## Introduction
Books Visualized is an app made entirely for visionOS and it's usage on Apple Vision Pro. It's built using the Google Books API and the data is storaged using User defaults.
Here you can search for books and mark them as favourites so they will appear in the favourites tab. This is my first visionOS app so i hope you enjoy it!
If you want to try it you just need a Google Books API key which is free, Xcode 15 Beta 2 and the visionOS simruntime.
